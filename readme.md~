Overloaded << operator so when you do cout << list << endl, it will print out the entire list]

at(), will return a pointer to the student that the node holds

Overloaded [] operator, when you do list[0] it will return a student pointer to the student held by node 0

insert(int index, Student* student), inserts the student pointer passed into the index in value

remove(int index), removes the node at the passed index

deleteStudent(Student* s) & deleteStudent(char* name), you can pass either a char* or Student*, it will find all instances of it in the list and delete it

append(Student* s), adds a student to the end

size(), returns the size of the linked list

begin(), returns a pointer to the first node in the list

end(), returns a pointer to the last node in the list

#Functions in Node

Node(Student*, Node* previous, Node* next), takes a student, the node behind it and the node after it

getNext(), returns the next node

getPrevious(), returns the previous node

setNext(node* node), sets the next node to the node argument

setPrevious(node* node), set the previous node to the previous node argument

getStudent(), returns a pointer to the node's student

setStudent(student* s), sets the node's student to the passed student

#Student Functions

Student(char* name, int ID), initializes the student with name and ID passed

getName(), returns the students name

getID(), returns the student's ID

setName(char* name), sets the students name to the passed name

setID(int ID), sets the student id to the id passed
